# Data Analytics Bootcamp Final Project

The project is about 'Facial emotion recognition" and focuses on using AI for facial emotion detection. 

## Project Goal
The main goal for this project is to determine  whether or not AI can be as good as human or better in facial emotion recognition. In theory, AI is expected to be free from subjective biases. However, exploring factors influencing the model, such as data quality and quantity, is crucial to understanding its performance.

## Main Points
### Data Collection:
Collect data from diverse sources, including web scraping, APIs, and flat files.

### Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Perform data cleaning and conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python.

### Database Creation:
Create a database to store and manage the cleaned data.

### Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD):
Develop an ERD to illustrate relationships between tables in the database.

### API Development:
Build an API to expose processed data and facilitate access for other users.

### Machine Learning Model Training:
Train a machine learning model and compare its performance with available models.
